I'm a creative coder fluent in interaction and information design. I create interfaces to navigate vast digital databases and experiences to explore them. 

I have both studio and freelance working experience. In the past I worked for clients like the Slovak National Gallery, studio Sub.digital, real estate developer HB Reavis and Goethe Institut Bratislava. For more information [download my CV](../matussolcany_cv_2021.pdf).
