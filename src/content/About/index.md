I’m a digital designer and creative coder proficient in interaction, information and visual design. My previous experiences and interests revolve around the creation of interfaces and experiences to navigate new emerging digital landscapes. I'm always on lookout for interesting overlaps of design, art, science and technology. My commercial and personal work usually comes in the form of interactive data visualisations and websites. 

I'm a proficient web developer and creative coder. I'm eager to turn my coding and design experiences into workshops where I introduce creative coding to artists and designers, I host these workshop irregularly at Design Academy Eindhoven.

I have both studio and freelance working experience. In the past I worked for clients like the Slovak National Gallery, the real estate developer HB Reavis and Goethe Institut. CV available on request.
