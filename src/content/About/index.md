I'm an information designer and frontend developer. Currently I work at the University of Amsterdam developing interfaces for data visualization and exploration. I have experience working both in studios and as a freelancer.

Previously I worked as a frontend developer at Kaspar AI on a prototypical interface for AI-assisted film editing tool. I've developed websites and digital experiences for clients including the Slovak National Gallery, real estate developer HB Reavis, the Goethe Institut, and the Universities of Edinburgh and Durham.
