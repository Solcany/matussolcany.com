I'm an information designer and frontend developer. I currently work at the University of Amsterdam developing interfaces for data visualization and exploration.

I have previously worked at Kaspar AI on a prototypical interface for AI-assisted film editing. I've developed websites and digital experiences for clients including the Slovak National Gallery, real estate developer HB Reavis, the Goethe Institut, and the Universities of Edinburgh and Durham.
