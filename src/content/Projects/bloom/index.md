description: Bloom visualizes the life of an online library in physical space as an ever blooming virtual plant

I collaborated with Lucia Dubačová and [Philo Van Kemenade](https://phivk.com/) to make an online library of Goethe Institut known as Onleihe visible in the space of the institute's physical library in Bratislava. Whenever a digital medium is returned to the online library a new flower starts to bloom on the spiral. Properties of virtual flowers are defined by the medium’s metadata like the medium's length or the year of publishing.
