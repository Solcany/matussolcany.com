Bloom makes the online library of Goethe Institut visible in the space of their physical library. Whenever a digital medium is returned to the online library a new flower starts blooming on the spiraling branch. Properties of virtual flowers are defined by the medium’s metadata.

This project is a result of collaboration with [Lucia Dubačová](https://medium.com/@dubacova.lucia) and [Philo Van Kemenade](https://phivk.com/).
