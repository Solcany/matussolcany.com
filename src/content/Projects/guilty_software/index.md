Guilty.software is a choose-your-own-adventure online experience. The project is a result of my masters studies [thesis]({{< relref "Projects/crime_prediction" >}}) completed at Design Academy Eindhoven.

Algorithmic crime prediction is a new technology used to predict potential victims and perpetrators of future crimes. However the technology perpetuates existing biases and criminalise poverty. Its workings and biases remain the secret of developers and police departments. 

The player assumes the role of the mayor of a fictional city where crime prediction technology is deployed. As mayor the player decides how the crime prediction is used and deals with consequences of their decisions. 

This project fuses the sparse and fragmented evidence from anecdotes, articles and available data on the workings of the technology into a singular visual narrative. 3D-scanning techniques are used to create metaphorical crime scenes inspired by digital forensics.
