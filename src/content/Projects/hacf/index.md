I designed these posters as a tribute to my favorite tv show Halt And Catch Fire. The visuals were created with a custom generative system and 3d scanning.

{{< img src="image/hacf3.jpg" caption="The generative process" alt="a triptych showing the generative process step by step: a uniform greyscale grid of lines, distorted grid, the distorted grid populated with blue, green and purple rectangles" fig_css="project_fig">}}

{{< img src="image/hacf4.jpg" caption="The generated grids were later used as standalone prints and were on display at the 2017 Sensorium festival In Bratislava" alt="a triptych showing 3 distorted grids populated with different blue, green, purple geometric shapes">}}
