[visit the website](https://senxskutocnost.sng.sk/en)

This website tells a story of the fascist Slovak State spanning years 1939-1945 in 4 chapters. This website was created in the time when a slovak neo nazi party ’Naše Slovensko’(Our Slovakia) won 8.06 % in the 2016 parliamentary elections. The website supported Slovak National Gallery’s exhibition of the same name and provided wider context. I was commisioned by [lab.SNG](https://lab.sng.sk/) to collaborate on this project. 

In 2017 this project won Biela Kocka award for the best educational project.
