[visit the website](https://senxskutocnost.sng.sk/en)

This website tells the story of the fascist Slovak State existing in 1939-1945 in 4 chapters. The website supported Slovak National Gallery’s exhibition of the same name and provided wider historical context. 

This project is a result of collaboration of [lab.SNG](https://lab.sng.sk/), [Philo Van Kemenade](https://phivk.com) and myself. In 2017 we won a Biela Kocka award for the best educational project.
