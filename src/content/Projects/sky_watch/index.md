Random numbers are crucial in generative art and generative neural networks. In these two contexts random numbers are usually obtained by algorithmic means. These mathematical functions create predictable, standardized randomness.

The goal of the Sky watch project is to use images of sky ( and potentially weather data ) as a source of unpredictable randomness.
