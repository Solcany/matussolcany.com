Unfortgattable is a museum installation that asks museum audience to explore and curate the scarcely visited digitised artworks: deciding whether an artwork should remain or to be forgotten. 

Unforgettable won an audience prize of HackaLOD hackathon in 2019 and is a result of collaboration of ExpLOD team: [Edward](https://twitter.com/anderson_edw), [Jorim](https://jtheuns.com/), [Philo](https://phivk.com/), [Ben](https://ben.companjen.name/) and myself.
