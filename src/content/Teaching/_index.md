# How can digitally native tools enhance the existing methods of designers and artists?

The popular digital tools of the past 3 decades used by artists and designers like Photoshop, Indesign or a text editor are often digitized versions of analog tools like pen, paintbrush, paper or a ruler. With these tools artists directly manipulate virtual materials on their screens to create unique pieces of work.

In my workshops I familiarize the students with tools that are inherently digital and offer new ways to create. With these tools artists and designers design systems that create unique work on their own. Instead of manually drawing with a pencil, the artist writes a recipe which then computer interprets and creates a drawing or a series of them. Hopefully there's a robot arm or a printer to materialize the drawing. This approach is also known as generative design or art. A more recent branch of the generative method uses machine learning to appropriate the style and content of images, sounds and texts to create new stylistically similar content. The human author shows a computer enough examples of a landscape or poetry and the computer will generate similar landscapes and poems.

These approaches are interesting because they restricts the artist in their ability to directly affect their work. But in exchange they lead to surprising and varying results that the artist hasn't thought of before. The aim of these workshops is to help students to find a way to utilise these digital tools in their own projects and to position computer as a collaborator rather than automator and a replacement of human creativity.

## Courses

My expertise covers visual generative art and animation with Processing and P5.js, photogrammetric 3D scanning with Metashape, Machine learning with RunwayML, Creating virtual spaces with Aframe and Web scraping with scrapy.

I offer intense 3 day project driven workshops where students are familiarized with the technical aspects of a workshop specific tool while working towards a small project. For deeper dives into the tools I offer trimester long courses where the tool and its application is discussed in conceptual and technical detail on a weekly basis.
