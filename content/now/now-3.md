I recently graduated with Information Design masters in Design Academy Eindhoven in the Netherlands. I’m still recovering from the graduation, in the meantime I held a 3 day 3d scanning and web development workshop at Design Academy Eindhoven.

Right now i’m finishing this portfolio and remixing my graduation project for an upcoming Rotterdam exhibition in March. I’m learning Godot game engine and reading Hamlet on the Holodeck.
