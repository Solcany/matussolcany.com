I’m a digital designer and developer based in The Netherlands. In my work I merge interactive, visual and informative elements to create compelling [experiences]({{< relref "/projects/unforgettable/index.md" >}}) and [narratives]({{< relref "/projects/triton/index.md" >}}). 

My background is in graphic and interactive design but in my early twenties I started teaching myself programming and I've been hooked ever since. I use code to create [prototypes]({{< relref "/projects/follower/index.md" >}}), [visualize data]({{< relref "/projects/ira-bots/index.md" >}}) and [generate artworks]({{< relref "/projects/hacf/index.md" >}}). Part of my career has been teaching programming and software tools to designers and artists, which I enjoy immensely. In my spare time I attend hackathons and game jams both as a [designer]({{< relref "/projects/klima/index.md" >}}) and a [developer]({{< relref "/projects/follower/index.md" >}}).

Curious about what i’ve been up to recently? Check [now]({{<relref "/now">}}).
