## How to make invisible online library visible in physical space?

Onleihe is online multimedia library of Goethe institut. Even though the library is regularly curated and new titles are added daily, it is known only a little. Goethe institutes around the world use a screen news feed that shows title and author of the most recently returned medium.

Instead of showing most recent instances of activity, we wanted to visualize the activity of the library as a living, breathing and growing system. Bloom is an ever growing animated spiral shaped branch, whenever a medium is returned to the library a new flower starts to bloom. Properties of the flower are parametrically defined by the medium’s metadata.

I collaborated with Lucia Dubačová and [Philo Van Kemenade](https://phivk.com/). At the beginning i worked on the concept, later on I drew flower sketches which became foundations for their parametric versions. In the end I designed the face of the visualization.
