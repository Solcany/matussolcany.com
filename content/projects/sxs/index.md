This website tells a story of the fascist Slovak State spanning years 1939-1945 in 4 chapters. This website was created in the time when a slovak neo nazi party ’Naše Slovensko’(Our Slovakia) won 8.06 % in the 2016 parliamentary elections. The website supported Slovak National Gallery’s exhibition of the same name and provided wider context.

I collaborated on this website with the amazing team of [lab.SNG](https://lab.sng.sk/). I helped to develop the sharing features and later on my role was to design visual style, the structure of the website and the user interface.

In 2017 this project won Biela Kocka award for best educational project.
