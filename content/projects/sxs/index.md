## A website with shareable and digestible story of the Slovak state during world war 2

The website was published in time when neo nazi party ’Naše Slovensko’
won 8.06 % in the 2016 elections and got into parliament. It was thus necessary to renew the memory of the nation by making the content easily shareable and distributable. The website supported Slovak National Gallery’s exhibition of the same name and provided wider context.

The story is divided into 4 digestible chapters. The website and individual chapters can be shared via emails, posted to facebook, or tweeted. It is also possible to print individual chapters.

I collaborated on this website with the amazing team of [lab.SNG](https://lab.sng.sk/). I helped to develop the sharing features and later on my role was to design visual style, the structure of the website and the user interface.

In 2017 this project won Biela Kocka award for best educational project.
