Pointfugue Meetups was a series of weekly coding meetups focused on making generative imagery with [Quil](http://quil.info/) (A Processing port) and [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) that I hosted at Design Academy Eindhoven in 2019. Leading up to the first meetup 5 unique posters were designed. I generated the whirlpool elements with Quil and the layout was done in collaboration with [Cinzia Bongino](https://www.cinziabongino.com/).
