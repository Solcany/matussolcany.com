[Pointfugue Meetups](#) were a series of weekly coding meetups focused on making generative imagery made with [Quil](http://quil.info/) and [Clojure](https://clojure.org/). Leading up to the first meetup a series of 5 unique posters was created. The spiral element of the posters was created with Quil and the layout was done in collaboration with [Cinzia Bongino](https://www.cinziabongino.com/).
