## Klima aims to be a new channel for discovery of digitized art collections in personal and relatable manner

### What is the global and immediate phenomenon that everybody can relate to? 

Weather and art both leave an emotional impact on us. Thus a link between im- mediate forces of nature and artificial yet emotional artwork can be established. Klima considers user’s local weather and matches it with an artwork that has a matching weather tag.

After the user is shown an artwork. He is offered an option to vote whether the artwork displayed on his device fits his current weather experience. If he decides that they match, the current weather-artwork relationship is consolidated. If they don’t match, the current weather-artwork relationship is weakened and the user is asked to choose a better fitting tag for the artwork. The tag, which was voted the most would be used.

### How much information about the local weather is displayed?

Only rudimentary weather information is provided on the user’s screen – just enough to judge the relationship between the artwork displayed and user’s local weather. Apart from comparing the relationship on the screen, a look from one’s window is also another viable option to make the judgement. Basic information about the weather also makes the app a useful and lightweight alternative to popular weather apps.

After that, the user will be given an option to choose a more fitting tag to the artwork" src2="image/klima3b.jpg" alt1="a screenshot of the app with a hand dragging the weather tag away from the painting" caption2="The current tag is weakened and the user is offered an option to choose more fitting one" alt2="a screenshot of the app showing a graphical bar above the painting reading: Thank you for imprpving this weather-artwork relationship">}}
