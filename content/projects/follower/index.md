## Follower is a shooter game which makes social pressure palpable in VR environment

In the age of social constant stream of likes, requests and notifications can be overwhelming. Follower asks a player how much pressure can she survive.
At start, the game needs the player to log in with her Facebook. The more friends the player has, the harder the game will be. Her friends will become her enemies.

Follower is result of joint effort of [Philo van Kemenade](https://phivk.com/), [Jan Kováříček](https://kovaricek.tumblr.com/) and myself at Bratislava Gamejam 2017 where it received honorary mention. I worked on the concept and later co-developed the game in Unity.
