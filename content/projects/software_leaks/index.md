I could put my blind grandma with no left hand and 2 fingers on the right hand on the PC and she could do 40k damage to a boss with an aspect char. If you leave someone behind over 40k hp then 1.) you’re an asshole, and 2.) maybe it’s time to invest in your guildies a little bit and teach them. Game isn’t difficult to do decent in, and that’s all you have to be... decent.
