In 2010 a cyber weapon  developed in collaboration between US’s NSA and Israel was discovered. It was used to prevent the Iranian nuclear facility from operation. Internally known as Olympic Games it became public as Stuxnet. Since then it became apparent that it is no longer just groups of hackers with limited budgets developing malicious software. 
Cyber weapons are developed with national budgets are leaked to the public and used against it. The immaterial and invisible nature of these weapons excludes them from the most of the news headlines. In my project i’m mapping the software leaks, the severeness of their contents, and their effects on the public domain.
