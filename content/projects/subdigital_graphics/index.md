Bratislava 2022 Model is an interactive model of the Nove Nivy downtown area of Bratislava. It is a tool for presentation of the real estate developments of this area commissioned by HB Reavis real estate developer.

I was commissioned by [Subdigital](https://www.sub.digital/project02/) studio in 2017 to develop a visual language for this model. The model allows to highlight various urban elements: offices, apartments, restaurants, schools, public transport roads & stops, streets, direction, points of interests and more. The challenge of this task was to develop an iconic and color language that would support multiple complex combinations of the highlighted urban elements while maintaining visual clarity.
