Unforgettable is an interactive installation meant for exploration and audience curation of the vast and often forgotten archives of digitized artworks of galleries. 

The installation puts the audience member in the position of a curator, over the time they get to decide which artworks will stay and which won't.

Unforgettable won an audience prize of HackaLOD hackathon in 2019. And is a creation of Ben, Jorim, [Philo](https://phivk.com/), Edward and myself.
